# Java Developer Roadmap

This repository provides a structured organization for learning and delving deeper into Java development, following the roadmap available at [roadmap.sh/java](https://roadmap.sh/java). The structure is divided into main topics, each with code examples, commented explanations, and a final project that integrates the concepts learned.

## Repository Structure

- **1. Java Fundamentals**
  - Basic structure of a Java program
  - Syntax, variables, and data types
  - Flow control (if/else, loops)
  - Commented examples

- **2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
  - Classes and objects
  - Inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
  - Interfaces and abstract classes
  - Commented examples

- **3. Data Structures and Collections**
  - Arrays, lists, maps, sets
  - Iterators and streams
  - Commented examples

- **4. File Handling and I/O**
  - Reading and writing files
  - Streams and buffers
  - Commented examples

- **5. Database Connectivity**
  - JDBC and ORM (Hibernate, JPA)
  - Basic SQL queries
  - Commented examples

- **6. Web Development with Java**
  - Servlets and JSP
  - Frameworks (Spring Boot)
  - REST APIs
  - Commented examples

- **7. Tools and Best Practices**
  - Maven and Gradle
  - Testing with JUnit
  - Logging with Log4j or SLF4J
  - Commented examples

## Final Project

A practical project integrating the topics above, such as a task management system. The project will include:
- A simple user interface
- Backend with Spring Boot
- Relational database
- Automated tests

## How to Use This Repository

1. Browse through the topic folders.
2. Read the examples and comments in each file.
3. Experiment with the code and modify it to reinforce your learning.
4. Contribute with improvements or new ideas for the final project!
